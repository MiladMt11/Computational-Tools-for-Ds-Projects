# Computational-Tools-for-Ds-Projects
This repo contains the projects I have done during the course "Computational Tools for Data Science" at DTU

## Project1
Data Analysis and ML Prediction on [TMDb](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started) dataset

## Project2
Using Spark to analyze data obtained from the Airbnb website (strictly speaking via data scraped by [insideairbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)). The purpose of your analysis is to extract insights about listings as a whole, specifics about London, and sentiment analysis of reviews (word positivity).

## Project3
Working with data streams
